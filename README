This is a demo about how to use QQ Connect's APIs, these APIs includes:
1. OAuth 2.0 and saving the access token & openid
2. Send tweet to Tencent Weibo
3. Send tweet with image to Tencent Weibo
4. Get my Tencent Weibo follower list
5. Get my Tencent Weibo following list
6. Add Tencent Weibo follower
7. Remove Tencent Weibo follower
8. Get Qzone profile

I will keep implementing the rest of QQ Connect's API, for a full list of these API, please visit: http://wiki.opensns.qq.com/wiki/%E3%80%90QQ%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95%E3%80%91API%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3

In this version, I use the API directly without QQConnect SDK. I will replace underlying code with QQCOnnect SDK gradually.
